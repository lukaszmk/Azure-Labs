#     title: "My Amazing New Lab"
#     difficulty: "Intermediate"

#     section: intermediate               # core, intermediate, advanced, specialized, optional, external
#     order: 225                          # Determines sort order (pick between existing labs)
#     journeys: [developer]               # Which learning paths include this lab
#
# That's it! Run .\scripts\Generate-Labs.ps1 -SkipPDFs and you're done.
#
# OPTIONAL FIELDS:
#   events: [bootcamp, mcs-in-a-day]     # Include in specific events
